list of rules:
- not too close to the edge
- not too close to other circles/points
- circle is not too small or too large
- should fail or stop drawing if number of points is too large (for example, 100 pts)

future:
- update the Gaussian map at every step
- analyze it with Voronoi - does it look good? we can play with the PDF
- what if you draw the lines first? and then place the pointso
